## Running React on Repl.it

[React](https://reactjs.org/) is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) is a blazing fast frontend build tool that includes features like Hot Module Reloading (HMR), optimized builds, and TypeScript support out of the box.

Using the two in conjunction is one of the fastest ways to build a web app.

### Getting Started
- Hit run
- Edit [App.jsx](#src/App.jsx) and watch it live update!

By default, Replit runs the `dev` script, but you can configure it by changing the `run` field in the [configuration file](#.replit). Here are the vite docs for [serving production websites](https://vitejs.dev/guide/build.html)

### Typescript

Just rename any file from `.jsx` to `.tsx`. You can also try our [TypeScript Template](https://replit.com/@replit/React-TypeScript)

# Finnhub Stock API is used. So a big shoutout to them.

### Functionalities
- You can see stats of various stocks and their past and present value.
- On Search Bar, you can select the stock which stats and data you want to see.
- After clicking the stats and data of stock are shown in the table given below.
- After hovering of stock you can see a red delet button. On clicking stock will be removed from table.
- If you want to see more information, click on stock and you get a graph of red(indicating fall) and green(indicating rise).
